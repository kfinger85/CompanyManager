## Entities

You have five entities (Company, Worker, Project, Qualification, WorkerProject), so you would have five entity classes.

## Repositories

Repositories abstract the data layer, providing an object-oriented view of the data source and adding a layer of abstraction over the querying language (like SQL). Generally, you would have a repository per entity, meaning you would have five repositories:

- CompanyRepository
- WorkerRepository
- ProjectRepository
- QualificationRepository
- WorkerProjectRepository

## Services

Services encapsulate your business logic. It's common to have a service per major functionality or business object in your application. However, it is not always necessary to have a 1:1 relationship between entities and services. In your case, you may have one service called CompanyService that uses the repositories to perform operations related to all these entities.

## Context

The DbContext in Entity Framework is a class that manages the database connections, query compilation, change tracking, update actions, and caching. Normally, you have only one context per database in your application. This context would manage all entities in your application. So, you would have only one context class, e.g., CompanyManagerContext.

Please note that this is a general guideline. The exact number and organization of your repositories, services, and contexts can vary depending on your specific application and its requirements. The key idea is to separate concerns so that each part of your application does one thing and does it well.

## `HttpContext` object
The `HttpContext` object is specific to a single request. However, ASP.NET Core is designed to handle multiple concurrent requests, each with their own `HttpContext` instance. So in an ASP.NET Core application, it is very likely that multiple HttpContext objects are being handled concurrently, each in its own thread of execution.

That being said, any single piece of middleware in your pipeline is going to process one request at a time per thread, but there can be many threads processing many different requests concurrently.

The use of `async` and `await` keywords allows your application to efficiently handle this concurrency, by freeing up threads to handle other requests when the current request is waiting for some I/O operation (like a database query or a call to an external web service) to complete.

This is why it's important to avoid storing per-request data in global or static variables, as such data won't be thread-safe. Instead, use the built-in dependency injection system in ASP.NET Core to manage per-request dependencies.
